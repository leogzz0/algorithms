# Merge Sort Algorithm in C++
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This C++ code implements the Merge Sort algorithm, which uses the "divide and conquer" technique to recursively break down a given array or list into smaller sub-arrays and then merge them back together in sorted order.

To use the code, simply input an array of doubles and it will be sorted using the Merge Sort algorithm. The sorted array will then be printed to the console.

The code defines two functions - merge() and mergeSort() - which handle the merging and sorting operations, respectively. The merge() function merges two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array, while the mergeSort() function recursively divides the array into smaller sub-arrays and calls the merge() function to merge them back together in sorted order.

## Input

The code takes an array of doubles as input and sorts it using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Output

The sorted array is then printed to the console.

## Test
To test this algorithm run compiler and then copy in terminal:
```
./main < Act-1-1-caso-1.txt
```

## Functions

The code defines two functions - `merge()` and `mergeSort()` - which handle the merging and sorting operations, respectively. 

The `merge()` function merges two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array, while the `mergeSort()` function recursively divides the array into smaller sub-arrays and calls the `merge()` function to merge them back together in sorted order.
